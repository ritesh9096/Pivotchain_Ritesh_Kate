Install dependencies:

If you are setting up a backend server using Express and Mongoose, you need to run npm i express mongoose in your project's root directory to install these dependencies. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed before running this command.
Start server:

After installing the dependencies, you can start your backend server by running node server.js (assuming your entry point is server.js). This will run your server on the specified port and start listening for incoming requests.
Open the index.html file and click on Go Live:

This step appears to be related to running a frontend application rather than the backend server. If you have a frontend application with an index.html file, you can use a tool like Visual Studio Code's "Live Server" extension or any other web server to serve the frontend locally. Clicking on "Go Live" in Visual Studio Code will launch a local development server and open your website in the browser.
